**Babyfish when?**

Ladyfish and myself are very excited to announce we are expecting a babyfish.

Several people have asked me over the past few months babyfish when? Well its official now.
Ladyfish is ten weeks along, so our babyfish is expected at the end of July.


I guess it's a little sad I have not posted anything on this site in a little over two years.

--insert obligatory I promise that I will post here more often--

Anyway before anybody has some stupid thought like oh no what will happen to IG, nothing is changing.
I spent most of the past year moving us around to the most well fitting and affordable hosting option and services so there is no problem.

*Happy Holidays*
